  <h2>Praise for fleishman is in trouble</h2></center> 
<P>
'This book... is the most astonishingly brilliant Trojan horse of a novel. Begins as a hilarious, fast paced tale of a middle-aged Manhattan man navigating fast sex culture of dating apps, ends as a gut-punch feminist text' - Dolly Alderton, author of Everything I Know About Love<br><br>

'Here is a portrait of modern love and marriage that is blisteringly funny, wincingly painful, and - ultimately both heartbreaking and humane. Fleishman Is in Trouble reminds me of the great novels of the 1960s and 1970s - just the sort of thing that Philip Roth or John Updike might have produced in their prime (except, of course, that the author understands woman). Taffy Brodesser Akner can write the pants off any novelist out there. She's a star, and this book is a work of utter perfection' - Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Eat, Pray, Love<br><br>

'From its opening pages, Fleishman Is in Trouble is shrewdly observed, brimming with wisdom and utterly of this moment. Not until its explosive final pages are you fully aware of its cunning ferocity. Taffy Brodesser-Akner's debut is that rare and delicious treat: a page turner with heft' - Maria Semple, Where'd You Go, Bernadette<br>
'Fans of Taffy Brodesse-Akner's whip-smart profiles will not be disappointed by her debut novel. Extending the same heady cocktail of forensic observation, sardonic wit and cynicism mixed with zeitgeist, Brodesser-Akner writes a novel for our times: what makes a marriage? A parent? A man? And when does it all end?"-Pandora Syke<br>
'I have just finished Fleishman Is in Trouble... and feel bereft. I read it too fast, because I couldn't stop, but can't bear that it's ended. It is a Great Novel (yes: cap G; Cap N). It has depth, wit, nuance and life. Heartbreaking and funny - Nigella Lawson<br></P><br><br><br><br>
