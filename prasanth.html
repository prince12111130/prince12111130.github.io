        <h2> FLEISHMAN IS IN TROUBLE</h2></center>
<h3><b><u> CHAPTER 1 :</u></b></h3>
<p> Toby Fleishman awoke one morning inside the city he'd lived in all his adult life and which was suddenly somehow now
    crawling with women who wanted him. Not just any women, but women who were self-actualized and independent and knew what
     they wanted. Women who weren't needy or insecure or self-doubting, like the long-ago prospects of his long-gone youth-meaning
      the women he had thought of as prospects but who had never given him even a first glance. No, these were women who were motivated
       and available and interesting and interested and exciting and excited. These were women who would not so much wait for you to
        call them one or two or three socially acceptable days after you met them as much as send you pictures of their genitals the
         day before. Women who were open-minded and up for anything and vocal about their desires and needs and who used phrases like
         <label>"put my cards on the table" </label> and <label>"no strings attached" </label> ,<label>"I need to be done in ten because I have to pick up Bella from
           ballet."</label>  Women who would fuck you like they owed you money, was how our friend Seth put it.</p>
<p>
    Yes, who could have predicted that Toby Fleishman, at the age of forty-one, would find that his phone was 
    aglow from sunup to sundown (in the night the glow was extra bright) with texts that contained G-string and ass cleavage and
    underboob and sideboob and just straight-up boob and all the parts of a woman he never dared dream he would encounter in a person
     who was three-dimensional -meaning literally three-dimensional, as in a person who wasn t on a page or a computer screen. 
     All this, after a youth full of romantic rejection! All this, after putting a lifetime bet on one woman! Who could have
      predicted this? Who could have predicted that there was such life in him yet?</p>
    <p>
    Still, he told me, it was jarring. Rachel was gone now, and her goneness was so incongruous to what had been his plan. It wasn't 
    that he still wanted her -he absolutely did not want her. He absolutely did not wish she were still with him. It was that he had
     spent so long waiting out the fumes of the marriage and busying himself with the paperwork necessary to extricate himself from
      it-telling the kids, moving out, telling his colleagues that he had not considered what life might be like on the other side of 
      it. He understood divorce in a macro way, of course. But he had not yet adjusted to it in a micro way, in the other-side-of-
      -bed-being-empty way, in the nobody-to-tell-you-were-running-late way, in the you-belong-to-no-one way. How long was it before 
      he could look at the pictures of women on his phone-pictures the women had sent him eagerly and of their own volition-straight 
      on, instead of out of the corner of his eye? Okay, sooner than he thought but not immediately. Certainly not immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
    He hadn't looked at another woman once during his marriage, so in love with Rachel was he-so in love was he with any kind of 
    institution or system. He made solemn, dutiful work of trying to save the relationship even after it would have been clear to 
    any reasonable person that their misery was not a phase. There was nobility in the work, he believed. There was nobility in the
     suffering. And even after he realized that it was over, he still had to spend years, plural, trying to convince her that this 
     wasn't right, that they were too unhappy, that they were still young and could have good lives without each other-even then he
     didn't let one millimeter of his eye wander. Mostly, he said, because he was too busy being sad. Mostly because he felt like
      garbage all the time, and a person shouldn't feel like garbage all the time. More than that, a person shouldn't be made horny
       when he felt like garbage. The intersection of horniness and low self-esteem seemed reserved squarely for porn consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
    But now there was no one to be faithful to. Rachel wasn't there. She was not in his bed. She was not in the bathroom, applying 
    liquid eyeliner to the area where her eyelid met her eyelashes with the precision of an arthroscopy robot. She was not at the gym,
     or coming back from the gym in a less black mood than usual, not by much but a little. She was not up in the middle of the night,
      complaining about the infinite abyss of her endless insomnia. She was not at Curriculum Night at the kids' extremely private and
       yet somehow progressive school on the West Side, sitting in a small chair and listening to the new and greater demands that were 
       being placed on their poor children compared to the prior year. (Though, then again she rarely was. Those nights, like 
        other nights, she was at work, or at dinner with a client, what she called <label>"pulling her weight"</label> when she was being kind,
         and what she called <label>"being your cash cow"</label> when she wasn't.) So no, she was not there. She was in a completely other home,
          the one that used to be his, too. Every single morning this thought overwhelmed him momentarily; it panicked him, so tha
          t the first thing he thought when he awoke was this: Something is wrong. There is trouble. I am in trouble. It had been 
          he who asked for the divorce, and still: Something is wrong. There is trouble. I am in trouble. Each morning, he shook t
          his off. He reminded himself that this was what was healthy and appropriate and the natural order. She wasn't supposed t
          o be next to him anymore. She was supposed to be in her separate, nicer home.</p>
