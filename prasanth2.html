    <h3> CHAPTER 2 :</h3>
    <P> But she wasn't there, either, not on this particular morning. He learned this when he leaned over to his new IKEA
        nightstand and picked up his phone, whose beating presence he felt even in those few minutes before his eyes officially
         opened. He had maybe seven or eight texts there, most of them from women who had reached out during the night via his
          dating app, but his eyes went straight to Rachel's text, somewhere in the middle. It seemed to give off a different
           light than the ones that contained body parts and lacy bands of panty; it somehow drew his eyes in a way the others
    didn't. At five A.M. she'd written, I'm headed to Kripalu for the weekend; the kids are at your place FYI.
   </P><P>
       It took two readings to realize what that meant, and Toby, ignoring the erection he'd allowed to flourish knowing that his
        phone was rife with new masturbation material, jumped out of bed. He ran into the hallway, and he saw that their two
         children were in their bedrooms, asleep. FYI the kids were there? FYI? FYI was an afterthought; FYI was supplementary. 
         It wasn't essential. This information, that his children had been deposited into his home under the cover of darkness 
         during an unscheduled time with the use of a key that had been supplied to Rachel in case of a true and dire emergency,
          seemed essential.
       
       He returned to his bedroom and called her. <label>"What were you thinking?"</label> he whisper-hissed into the phone. Whisper-hissing
        still did not come easily to him, but he was getting better at it every day. "What if I'd gone out and not realized they 
        were there?"</P>
        <P>
       
       <label>"That's why I texted you,"</label> she said. Her response to whisper-hissing was eye-rolling glibness.
       
       <label>"Did you bring them here after midnight? Because I went to sleep at midnight."</label>
       
       "I dropped them off at four. I was trying to get in for the weekend. There was a cancellation. The program starts at nine
       . Give me a break here, Toby. I'm having a hard time. I really need some me time." As if all her time weren't completely
        and totally her-time.
       
       <label>"You can't pull this kind of shit, Rachel."</label> He only said her name at the end of sentences now, Rachel.
       
       <label>"Why? You had them this weekend anyway."</label>
       
       "But not till tomorrow morning!" Toby put his fingers to the bridge of his nose. "The weekends begin Saturday. This was your rule,
        not mine." "Did you have plans?"
       
       "What does that even mean? What if there had been a fire, Rachel? What if there had been an emergency with one of
        my patients, and I ran out without knowing they were here?"
       
       "But you didn't. I'm sorry, I should have woken you up and told you they were there?" He thought of her waking him up, how it
        could have been catastrophic to his progress in understanding that
       
       she was no longer part of his waking up. "You shouldn't have done it at all," he said.
       
       "Well, if what you were saying last night is true,
       
       then you could have predicted this would happen." Toby searched his bleary brain for their last hateful interaction and remembered
        it with the force of a sudden, deep dread: Rachel had been sputtering some nonsense about opening up a West Coast office of her 
        agency, because she was not busy enough and overwhelmed enough as it was. Honestly, it was blur. She'd ended the a conversation,
         he remembered now, by screaming at him through her sobbing so that he couldn't understand her until finally the line went dead
          and he knew she'd hung up on him. This was how conversations ended now, rather than with the inertia of marital apology. Toby
           had been told all his life that being in love means never having to say you're sorry. But no, it was actually being divorced
            that meant never having to say you're sorry.</P>
            <p>
       
       "This hasn't been easy on me, Toby," she said now. "I get that I'm early. But all you have to do is drop them at camp.
        If you have plans, ask Mona to come. Why are we even still talking about this?"
       
       How could she not see that this wasn't a small deal? He actually did have a date that night. He didn't want to leave the 
       kids with Mona-that was Rachel's solution to everything, not his. He couldn't seem to convey to her that he was a real person,
        that he was not a blinking cursor awaiting her instructions, that he still existed when she wasn't in a room with him. He 
        couldn't understand what the goal of having all these agreements in place was if she wasn't going to even pretend to adher
        e to them, or apologize when she didn't. He'd given her a key to his new apartment not to pull shit like this, but so they 
        could have something that was amicable. Amicable amicable amicable. Did you ever notice that you only use the word amicable 
        in relation to divorce? Was it because it was so often used for divorce that you didn't want to poison anything else with it? 
        The way you could say "malignant" for things other than cancer but you never did?
       
       The kids were stirring and it was just as well because his boner was gone.
       
       Solly, his nine-year-old, woke up, but Hannah, who was eleven, wanted to stay in bed. "Sorry, kid, no dice," Toby told her.
        "We have to be out the door in twenty." They stumbled into the kitchen with unfocused eyes, and Toby had to muck around in
         their bags to find the clothing they were supposed to wear for camp that day. Hannah snarled at him that he'd chosen the wrong
          outfit, that the leggings were for tomorrow, and so he held up her tiny red shorts and she swiped them out of his hands with
           the disgust of a person who was not committed to any consideration of scale when it came to emotional display. Then she flared
            her nostrils and stiffened her lips and told him somehow without opening her teeth that she had wanted him to buy Corn Flakes
            , not Corn Chex, the subtext being what kind of fucking idiot was she given for a father.
       
       Solly, on the other hand, ate his Corn Chex cheerfully. He closed his eyes and shook his head with pleasure. 
       <label>"Hannah,"</label> he said. <label>"You have to try these."</label></p><P>
       
       Toby was not above being grateful for Solly's sad show of solidarity. Solly understood. Solly knew. Solly was his
        in a way that made him never wonder if all of this had been worth it. He had Toby's same internal need for things to be okay.
         Solly wanted peace, just like his father. They even looked alike. They had the same black hair, the same brown eyes
          (though Solly's were slightly larger than Toby's and so gave the appearance of always being a little scared), the same 
          comma-shaped nose, the same miniatureness-meaning not just that they were short, but they were short and regular-sized.
           They weren't slight or diminutive, so that if you were to see them without a height benchmark, you wouldn't understand
            just how short they were. This was good because it was hard enough to just be short. This was bad because it meant
             disappointing people who had seen you in just such a benchmark-deprived way and had expected you to be bigger.
       
       Hannah was his, too, yes, except that she had Rachel's straight blond hair and narrow blue eyes and sharp nose-her whole 
       face an accusation, just like her mother's. But she had a specific kind of sarcasm that was a characteristic of the Fleishman
        side. At least she once did. Her parents' separation seemed to ignite in her a humorlessness and a fury that had already bee
        n coming either because her parents fought too often and too viciously, or because she was becoming a teenager and her hormones 
        created a rage in her. Or because she didn't have a phone and Lexi Leffer had a phone. Or because she had a Facebook account she
         was only allowed to use on the computer in the living room and she didn't even want that Facebook account because Facebook was
          for old people. Or because Toby suggested that the sneakers that looked just like Keds but were 12 less were preferable to the
           Keds since again they were exactly the same just without the blue tag on the back and what about being too-overt victims of
            consumerism? Or because there was a sad popular song on the radio about a long-gone romance that meant a lot to her and he
             had asked her to turn down her speakers while he was on the phone with the hospital. Or because later when she explained
              why that sad popular song was so meaningful by making him listen to it she seethed at him because he didn't appear to m
              agically understand how a song could ignite in her a nostalgia that she couldn't possibly have had, never having had a
               boyfriend. Or because he wondered if her skirt was too short to sit down in. Or because he wondered if her shorts wer
               e too short if they showed the crease between her buttocks and thighs and were even so short that their full pocket
                linings couldn't be contained by them and so extended beyond the shorts' hem. Or because he asked where her hairbrus
                h was, which clearly implied, to her, that he thought her hair looked terrible. Or because she. did. not. want. to. see
                . The Princess Bride or any of his old-man movies. Or because he ran his hand across her head one day in a display of
                 tenderness, ruining her very perfect middle part that had taken ten minutes to get right. Or because no. she. did. 
                 not. want. to. read The Princess Bride either, or any of his old-man books. Yes, her contempt for her parents, which
                  seemed manageable when it was aimed at both Rachel and Toby, was absolutely devastating in its current concentration
                   when it was directed only at him. He had no idea if she saved any of it for Rachel. All Toby knew was that Hannah
                    could barely look at him without her lake water eyes narrowing even further into lasers and her nose becoming
                  somehow pointier than it was and her lips turning white with purse.
               </P><p>
       They inched toward camp, irate and unfocused, because they were tired (See, Rachel? See?).
       
       <label>"I hate camp," Hannah said. "</label>Can't I just stay home?" She'd wanted to go to sleepaway camp for the whole summer, 
       but her bat mitzvah was in early October, and she had still needed June and July to learn her haftorah.
       
       <label>"You're leaving in like a week. One more lesson
       
       left."</label>
       
       <label>"I want to leave now."</label>
       
       <label>"Should I maybe rent you an apartment in the interim?"</label> Toby asked. Solly laughed at least.
       
       They arrived at the 92nd Street Y, along with all the mothers in their brightly patterned leggings and their 
       exercise shirts that said YOGA AND VODKA or EAT SLEEP SPIN REPEAT. This place cost about as much as sleepaway camp, and Hannah
        kept asking if she could skip being a camper and instead become some kind of counselor assistant, which you weren't allowed to
         do until tenth grade anyway.
       
       <label>"Even then, it still costs money to go," Toby said when he looked at the Y's website. </label><label>"Why do I have to pay for you to learn how 
       to be a counselor while they use you as an actual counselor?" </label>he'd asked her in the spring.
       
       <label>"Why did you have to pay to learn how to be a doctor while they used you as an actual doctor?" </label>she'd answered. It was a good point.
        Toby thought then how sharp she was, and how he wished she didn't deploy this sharpness exclusively against him. She was becoming,
         it seemed to him, the kind of girl that it was completely exhausting to be.
       
       They had made it with maybe six minutes to spare. The Y took them to a campus in the Palisades every day,
        and if you dropped them off too late, they had to spend the entire day in the room with the very little children. 
        Hannah declined her father's offer to escort her to her gathering classroom, so he took Solly to his. Toby watched
         him as he participated in the last minutes of the morning slime experiment, and was just about to exit the lobby when he heard
          his name being called.
       
       <label>"Toby," </label>called a low, breathy woman's voice. Toby turned around to see Cyndi Leffer, a good friend of Rachel's
        who had a daughter in Hannah's grade. She took a moment to survey him. Ah, this. He knew what was coming: the head 
        tilted twenty degrees, the exaggerated pout, the eyebrows
       
       simultaneously raised and furrowed. <label>"Toby. I keep meaning to reach out to you,"</label>
       
       Cyndi said. <label>"We haven't seen an inkling of you."</label>
        This place cost about as much as sleepaway camp, and Hannah kept asking if she could skip being a camper and instead become some kind of counselor assistant, which you weren't allowed to do until tenth grade anyway.
      
    <label>"Even then, it still costs money to go,"</label> Toby said when he looked at the Y's website. <label>"Why do I have to pay for you to learn how to be a counselor while they use you as an actual counselor?"</label> he'd asked her in the spring.
