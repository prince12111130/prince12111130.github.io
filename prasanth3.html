<h3>CHAPTER 3:  </h3>
<p> 
    Toby and Rachel had separated at the very beginning of June, just after school ended, the culmination of an almost yearlong process, or maybe a process that began shortly after their wedding fourteen years before; it depends whom you ask or how you look at a thing. Is a marriage that ends doomed from the start? Was the marriage over when the problems that would never get solved started or when they finally agreed that the problems couldn't be solved or when other people finally learned about it?
</p><p>
Of course Cyndi Leffer wanted information. Everyone did. The conversations were always artless, and they were always the same. The first thing people wanted to know was how long things in the marriage had been bad for: Were you unhappy that night at the school gala, when you were showing off your college swing dancing lessons? Were you unhappy at that bat mitzvah when you took her hand and kissed it absentmindedly during the speeches? Was I right that at parent-teacher conferences when you stood by the coffee and she stood by the office checking her phone you were actually fighting? How it shook people to see someone extricate themselves from a bad situation; how people so brazenly wondered aloud every private thing there was to wonder. Toby's cousin Cherry, who was prone to long, disappointed stares at her husband, Ron: "Had you tried therapy?" His boss, Donald Bartuck, whose second wife had been a nurse on the hepatology floor: "Were you unfaithful?" The camp director at the Y, when Toby was explaining that his kids might be a little shaky since when camp started, they'd just separated: "Did you guys have a regular date night?"
</p><p>
These questions weren't really about him; no, they were questions about how perceptive people were and what they missed and who else was about to announce their divorce and whether the undercurrent of tension in their own marriages would eventually lead to their demise. Did the fight I had with my wife on our actual anniversary that was particularly vicious mean we're going to get divorced? Do we argue too much? Do we have enough sex? Is everyone else having more sex? Can you get divorced within six months of an absentminded hand-kiss at a bat mitzvah? How miserable is too miserable?
</p>
<p> 
    How miserable is too miserable?

One day he would not be recently divorced, but he would never forget those questions, the way people pretended to care for him while they were really asking after themselves.

He had spent the early summer in a haze, trying to find footing in this strange world where every aspect of his life was just slightly different than it used to be and yet immensely so: He was sleeping, just alone and in a different bed. He was eating with the kids just like always-Rachel hadn't come home before eight or nine on weeknights in years but after dinner he dropped them off at the old apartment and walked the nineteen blocks home to his new one. That slippery fuck Donald Bartuck told him he, Bartuck, was being promoted to head of internal medicine and that he was putting Toby up as his only candidate for subdivision head of hepatology in the gastroenterology division once the current one, Phillipa London, evacuated the post to take Bartuck's job. He didn't have the natural first person to tell. He thought about calling me or Seth, but it seemed too pathetic to not have an actual family member to tell. He almost called his parents in Los Angeles, but the time difference put them at five A.M. when he learned; then he debated if this was news that Rachel should hear or know. (He did tell her, later when he dropped the kids off, and she smiled with her mouth but not her eyes. She did not have to pretend to care about his career anymore.)
</p><p>
But now, in late July, as summer was rounding second base, he felt steady again, like at least he had a routine. He was coming along nicely. He was adjusting. He was cooking for one less person. He was learning to use the I instead of we to indicate availability for barbecues and cocktail parties, when he was invited, which wasn't often. He was taking long walks again and learning to bat away the feeling that he should let someone know where he was. Yes, he was coming along nicely, except for conversations like this one, with Cyndi. He had been wallpaper to the Cyndi Leffers of the world before this; he'd been a condition that came co morbid with his family. Successful Rachel's husband, or social Hannah's father or cute Solly's father, or, hey, you're a doctor, right, will you just look at this bump I've had for a week? Now he was someone people wanted to talk to. His divorce had somehow given him a soul.

Cyndi was waiting for an answer. Her eyes were searching his face the way soap opera actors looked at each other in the seconds before commercial breaks. He knew what was expected of him. He was working on trying to not fill in this pause; he was working on letting the discomfort of the silence be the property of the person who was mining him for dirt. His therapist, Carla, was trying to get him to learn how to sit with uncomfortable feelings. He, in turn, was trying to get the people who were pumping him for information to learn to sit with uncomfortable feelings.

But also: There was no way to talk about a divorce without implying terrible things about the other person in the marriage, and he didn't want to do that. He felt a strange call for diplomacy now. School was a battleground state, and it would be so easy to get people over to his side, he knew that. He knew he could allude to Rachel's craziness, her anger, her tantrums, her unwillingness to immerse herself in her children's lives-he could say things like "I mean, I'm sure you noticed that she never came to STEM Night?" but he didn't want to. He didn't want to undermine Rachel's status at school out of an old sense of protectiveness that he couldn't quite shake. She was a monster, yes, but she had always been a monster, and she was still his monster, for she had not yet been claimed by another, for he was still not legally done with her, for she still haunted him.
</p><p>
Cyndi took a step closer. He was only five-five, and she was a full head taller than him and skinnier than any woman needed to be. Her face was large-featured and pumped full of hyaluronic acid and botulinum toxin. Her concern, which was mostly transmitted via a slow back-and-forth shaking of the head and an exaggerated protrusion of her mouth, was mitigated by the fact that her browline was completely ossified, and had been since he'd known her. This was what she looked like when she was happy, too. "Todd and I were so sad to hear," she said. "If there's anything we can do. We're your friends, too."

Then she took another step closer, which was two too many steps close for a camp lobby encounter with a married woman who was friends with his wife. His phone buzzed. He looked down. It was Tess, a woman he had plans to meet for the first time later that night. He squinted at his phone to see a close-up photograph of the fertile crescent where her thighs and her black, netted panties formed a delta.

"That's work," Toby said to Cyndi. "I have a biopsy to get to."

"You still at the hospital?"

"Uh, yeah," he said. “As long as people still get sick. Supply and demand."
</p><p>
Cyndi gave a one-syllable laugh but looked at him with, what? Sympathy? All the school parents did. A doctor wasn't a thing to be anymore. Just last year Cyndi's husband, Todd, had looked at him earnestly at parent-teacher conference night, while they waited outside classrooms for their names to be called (no Rachel in sight, because she was at a client dinner and would not arrive in time) and said, "If your kids told you they wanted to be doctors, how would you advise them?" Toby hadn't quite understood the question until his walk home from school, at which point he'd realized it was a guy in finance feeling sorry for a guy in medicine. A doctor! He had been raised to think that a doctor was a respectable thing to be. It was a respectable thing to be! When Rachel got home that night, he told her what that douche Todd had asked him, and she said, "Well, what would you say?" They had all turned on him.

"You better get going, then," Cyndi said now. "We'll see Hannah tomorrow night, right?" She leaned over to give him a full frontal three-point hug with connection at the head, chest, and pelvis. The hug lingered for a millisecond longer than any previous physical contact he'd ever had with Cyndi Leffer, which was zero.

He walked away from the Y, wondering if the vibe he got off Cyndi-that she wanted to comfort him, yes, but, also, to fuck him as well-was real. It couldn't be. And yet. And yet. And yet and yet and yet and yet and yet she was clearly wondering what it might be like to fuck him.
</p><p>
No, it couldn't be. He thought about the way her nipples lined up so evenly and soldier-like under her stupid tank top. He was getting carried away, which is an easy thing to do when your phone is literally dripping with the lust of women who did definitely and assuredly claim to want to fuck you, fuck you bad, fuck you bad all night long.

Each little holler he got-each little [winky emoji] or [purple devil emoji] or bra selfie or actual photographed upper-region ass crack-made him revisit the essential questions of his youth: Could it be that he wasn't as repulsive as he'd been led to believe by the myriad rejections of just about every single girl he'd ever made eye contact with? Could it be that he was maybe attractive? Was it not his looks or his physique but the desperation inherent in his attempts at a rigorous sex life in those days, or any sex life really, that rendered him something less attractive than he actually was? Or maybe now there was something about his current situation, being newly divorced and a little wounded, that had somehow made him that way. Or maybe absent mirror neurons and pheromones and other things that could not penetrate phone screens, all you had was a reflection of the intersection of your own horniness and your own availability, and the minute someone else's horniness and availability matched up with yours, voilà and kaboom. He didn't like to think that, that sex was no longer about attraction, but he couldn't pretend it wasn't a possibility; he was a scientist, after all.

He'd met Rachel when he was a first-year in med school. He thought about that time nearly constantly now. He thought of the decisions he'd made and whether he could have seen the warning signs. Her at that library party, her eyes flashing sex, her hair the same blond Cleopatra shape it would continue to be forever. How his eyes filled at the sight of the gleam of her geometry hair. How the blue of her eyes was both cold and hot. How the Cupid's bow beneath her nose was a dewdrop mountain to be climbed; how it mirrored the cleft in her chin with the kind of symmetry that science said initiated male sexual imperative and created visual gratification and hormonal feelings of well being. How the sharpness of her face seemed like a correction to the Semitic girls he was bred to want -her father hadn't been Jewish, and by the account of her grandmother and the few pictures that existed of him, she looked just like him, and that, too, felt dangerous that someone raised as traditionally as Toby would love a woman who looked like her absent Gentile father.
